# Programming

> What is programming?

It's activity to write a computer programs.

> What is programming language?

It's a language to give instructions to a computer.

> What is programming paradigm?

The term of paradigm in a programming is a general classification or model or style of doing something. There are two main classification in programming paradigms: imperative and declarative.

Imperative programming refers to code that tells computer "how" to do something. Declarative programming refers to code tells computer "what" to do. The main difference between imperative programming and declarative programming is the imperative programming has control flow and declarative programming doesn't. The control flow in imperative programming refers to the ability to manipulate the order of execution of statements in a program. Example keywords are `if else`, `while`, `for` loop.

There are programming languages that used imperative programming: JavaScript, PHP, Python, Go, Rust, C, Ruby, C++, Zig, etc. Meanwhile, the programming languages that used declarative programming are domain specific language for example SQL is programming language to query database, HTML and CSS is programming language for web page (HTML for markup and CSS for style and layout).

> Wait! You say that HTML and CSS are a programming language? Non sense!

Previously, I doubt that HTML and CSS are a programming language. But, after I listen explaination from Lara Schenk about CSS algorithm and supporting arguments from Heydon and Professor Brailsford about HTML is a programming language, I'm more confident to say that HTML and CSS are a programming language. To be more precice: HTML and CSS are a domain specific programming language to build web page. HTML is a programming language to make meaningful content on web and CSS is a programming language for styling the content on web.
