Hi! This is my personal note of what I learn. If you see this note is beneficial for you, thank you!

## Background

I imagine myself in this scenario.

> I learn a thing, either easy or difficult. The thing contains a lot of to do steps and sometimes repetitive. One day, I left it then let it go around couple months. Next, I come back and want to do that but I forget how to do that and takes a couple times to remember. The root cause is I'm not documenting it.

> Maybe you have been on this scenario, right? ðŸ˜…

Software like Notion or Obsidian may help me to document what I have done. But, I use it as a private note and not a public note. Although they are provide an option to share my notes public, but I want to try in different way.

I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown. Rather than collect all of my notes in Notion or Obsidian, I would like to convert it into a website and add some interactive features. Luckily, Astro ships Starlight, a framework to put my notes into a better document.
